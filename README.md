# Scientific Article Section Classification

This service is responsible for the classification of scientific article sections in different predefined section labels. 

Actually it uses a set of 9 labels: 'introduction', 'background', 'case', 'method', 'result', 'discussion', 'conclusion' and 'additional'.



## Installation
For the moment there are no installation instructions. The will follow.

## Usage 

The article segmentation tool can be used in different ways, each one fulfilling a different purpose: (i) preprocessing, (ii)Training; and (iii) REST API Controller, which can be used to segment new articles based on the trained models.


### (i) Preprocessing 

TBD

### (ii) Training

TBD

### (iii) Run the REST API Controller using FLASK and Python
